 Materials for The Graduate Center's Spring 2016 Economics Development II PhD seminar.


 __Lectures and Reading Notes written as Jupyter Notebooks__

This is a repository of [jupyter notebooks] on Development
Microeconomics.  It is starting off rather small but I intend to add
more material over time on classic (and not so classic) models
and empirical studies in the fields of trade and growth,
household economics, equilibrium models of the size distribution of firms,
the political economy of property rights and institutions, the microeconomic
theory of contracts and intermediation, and program impact evaluation.  

These are all topics we are covering in the course of a Spring 2016 PhD
Development Economics seminar at The Graduate Center of the
City University of New York.

This is less like a coherent sequential collection of lecture notes and more
like an idiosyncratic collection of reading notes with
embedded model simulations and data analyses for a set of interesting
academic papers and useful model frameworks. Some are just notes and tips
on jupyter notebooks and scientific python for building useful model simulations
or visualizations.   

The notebooks are in the [notebooks folder] of this repository. The best way
to explore the content is to clone
this repository to your own computer or cloud service and run them
interactively there.  If you just want to view them with out interaction
the Links in the table below lead to static views via the jupyter [nbviewer]
service.

The course site [dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.org] has the reading list
and syllabus for the course and auto-generated styled HTML and PDF versions of
all this content (but as of 2/6 not all repo content was converting).

There are only a few draft notebooks in the collection now.  I hope to expand
this somewhat as the semester advances.  I welcome your comments, suggestions
and contributions (feel free to open a github issue or make a pull request).
