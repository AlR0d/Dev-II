 __Lecture and reading Notes as Jupyter Notebooks__

This is a repository of [jupyter notebooks] on Development
Microeconomics. The collection has started out small and rough but should grow
and improve over the course of time. I hope to write-up notebooks on papers
in the fields of trade and growth, household economics, equilibrium models
of the size distribution of firms, the political economy of property rights and
institutions, the theory of contracts and intermediation (in markets for
land, labor and financial services), and on RCTs and program impact evaluation.  

This is less like a coherent sequential collection of lecture notes and more
like an idiosyncratic collection of reading notes with
embedded model simulations and data analyses for a set of interesting
academic papers and useful model frameworks.

Several notebooks are posted as
first rough first drafts with simple and often incomplete analyses of
a model or reading. I will hopefully rewrite and improve these over time.  
I welcome all comments, suggestions and contributions (feel free to open
a github issue, or make a pull request).

All notebooks are in the [notebooks folder]. The best way
to explore the content is to clone
this repository to your own computer or cloud service and run them
interactively there.  If you just want to view them with out interaction
the Links in the table below lead to static views via the jupyter [nbviewer]
service.

The course site [dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.org] has the reading list
and syllabus for the course and auto-generated styled HTML and PDF versions of
all this content (but as of 2/6 not all repo content was converting).

There are only a few draft notebooks in the collection now.  I hope to expand
this somewhat as the semester advances.
