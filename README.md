 __Lecture and reading Notes as Jupyter Notebooks__

This is a repository of [jupyter notebooks] on topics in the Microeconomics of
Development. There are only a couple rough notebooks here now, but over time
these should become more numerous and more polished. Some notebooks offer
just simple analytic summaries of interesting topics or academic papers, while
others provide code for simulations and visualizations of applied theory models
to replicate and extend results. I hope to add a few replications of empirical
papers as well. Topics are drawn from the fields of trade and growth,
household economics, agrarian production structure and the equilibrium
size distribution of firms, the political economy of property rights,
institutions and policy reform, the theory of contracts and intermediation
(in markets for land, labor and financial services), as well as papers on
targeting, RCTs and program impact evaluation.

In its present form this is much less like a coherent sequential collection
of lecture notes and more like an idiosyncratic collection of reading notes
and materials that complement lecture notes by inviting you to explore and
extend the embedded simulations and data analyses.

If you click [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/jhconning/Dev-II)
you will launch a cloud-based juptyer notebook server that will allow you to
run any of the notebooks interactively.  Alternatively, clone this github
and run them on your own computer.

The following table describes the contents of the notebooks folders and links
to quick static views of the notebook content.

The course site [dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.org] has the reading list
and syllabus for the course and auto-generated styled HTML and PDF versions of
all this content (but sometimes not all repo content converts).
