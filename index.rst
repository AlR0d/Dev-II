The rest of the site is a very early stab at assembling lecture
notes and reading notes on development microeconomics topics all written
as interactive jupyter notebooks (described below).

This is a *very* preliminary set of notes.  Over time I'll post new content and
improve the posted drafts. If you spot errors or would like to suggest edits or
contribute material please do so via the github repository
(start an 'issue ticket'):
