This is a rough assembling of reading and
lecture notes on development microeconomics topics all written
as interactive jupyter notebooks. The content can be read in a variety of ways: (1) as webpages  http://dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.io/
(2) as a PDF book: http://readthedocs.org/projects/dev-ii-seminar/downloads/pdf/latest/ or (3) as jupyter notebooks and other files at: https://github.com/jhconning/Dev-II

These are *very* preliminary.  Over time I'll improve the posted drafts.
