The rest of the site is a very rough assembling of reading and
lecture notes on development microeconomics topics all written
as interactive jupyter notebooks.

This is *very* preliminary.  Over time I'll improve the posted drafts.
If you spot errors or would like to suggest edits or
contribute material please do so via the github repository
