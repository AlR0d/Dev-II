This high wage will lead firms in that sector to cut back hiring but will also attract migrants to urban areas. lured by the prospect of possibly landing a high-wage job in the urban sector.  Since not all migrants succeed in landing these rationed jobs however this migration will lead to the endogenous emergence of an informal urban sector in the economy and 'urban-bias' (a larger than efficient urban sector).\n"
